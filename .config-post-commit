# It is recommended to create symbolic links to
# a single config file for using the same settings
# across repositories. Doing so, you can edit/update
# your configuration parameters by editing a single 
# configuration file.
#
# The following variables can be set to suite
# your needs:
#
# MAIL_TO='list of email addresses'
# MAIL_CC='list of email addresses'
# MAIL_BCC='list of email addresses'
# MAIL_BODY_PREFIX='a text message to be placed before the 
# commit diff.'
# MAIL_BODY_POSTFIX='a text message to be placed after the 
# commit diff.'

MAIL_TO='CVS-SDK <CVS-SDK@ubicom.com>'
MAIL_CC='linux-all <linux-all@ubicom.com>'
